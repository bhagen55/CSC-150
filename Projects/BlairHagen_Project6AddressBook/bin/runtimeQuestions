1. What is the big-O runtime (in terms of the size of the address book) of adding an entry to your address book?
	Because of findNodeBefore() stepping through the linkedList, the worst case runtime is O(n)
2. What is the big-O runtime of finding an entry in your address book?
    Because of searchNode() stepping through the linkedList, the worst case runtime is O(n)
3. What is the big-O runtime of removing an entry from your address book?
	Because of searchNode() and findNodeBefore() stepping through the linkedList, worst case runtime is O(n) 
4. What would be the big-O runtimes for each of these three methods if you implemented your address book using an array instead of a linked list?
	They would all be O(n) because every method has to at least step through the array, or create new arrays and fill them with data.
