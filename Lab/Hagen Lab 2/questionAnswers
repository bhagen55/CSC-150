1. DrawingBox myBoard;  This line creates an object variable of type DrawingBox called myBox.
myBoard = new DrawingBox();  This line invokes the constructor method and adds whatever is needed to memory for the object.
myBoard.setVisible(true);  This line calls the method setVisible inside the class DrawingBox and applies it to the object myBoard.
myBoard.drawRect(320,230,120,180);  This line calls the method drawRect inside the class DrawingBox and applies it to the object myBoard.

2. The constructor method was invoked on line 2 when myBoard is set equal to new DrawingBox().
It is legal to use the constructor with no methods because the documents show the constructor DrawingBox() as valid.
It could have accepted a string argument that would have titled the box with the string argument given.

3. drawRect represents a method within the class DrawingBox.
The version being used is the one that draws the outline of a specified rectangle using the given dimensions.
I know this because the arguments used in the code match the arguments used in the documents.
The arguments represent the x coord and y coord of the rectangle and the width and height of the rectangle.
