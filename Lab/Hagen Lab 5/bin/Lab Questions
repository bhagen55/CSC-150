1. Worst case runtimes for three written methods
	removeHead has notation O(1).
	insertAtTail has notation O(n).
	search has notation O(n).
2. Running time comparison for an array with remove head
	The operation on an array would be much longer as an array must have all the elements moved to the left one.
	An array's removeHead O notation would be O(n), versus the O(1) of linkedNode removeHead.
3. Running time comparison for search method
	They are the same as both must step through every element in the array/linkedlist.
	They are both O(n).
