step through the linkedlist until the nodeBefore is found, then make a new node with given
event and insert that node after nodeBefore and connect the new node to the later nodes.

(precondition: the linkedList has at least one node)

runner equals the first node
while the runner doesn't equal the nodeBefore
	set runner equal to the next node

make a new node using the event data
set the runners next node to the new nodes next node
set the runners next node to the new node
